## Why
This project was created as part of Wyncode Cohort 38’s midterm project. The project requires linking an API and enabling a filtering mechanism from a search. We chose crypotcurrency as our topic because of it’s growing influence in global finance.

## Who
We are currently studying at Wyncode to become Full-Stack JavaScript developers.
Sonny Castro, Ana Souza, & Priscilla Standard all contributed equally to create this app.

## How
(Dependencies)
Yarn, Axios, Bootstrap, React - all of the following must be installed prior to coding.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript were all used.

## Install

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd` into it.
- `yarn install`
- `cd client && yarn install`

- `yarn dev`: Runs BOTH your Express.JS and React developer environment locally at the same time. Any logs coming from Express will be prefaced with `[0]`, any logs from `create-react-app` will be prefaced with `[1]`.
- `yarn server`: Runs JUST your Express.JS server.
- `yarn client`: Runs JUST your front-end React app.

## Deploy
NOTE: You must remove your package.json file and re-commit before deploying.
